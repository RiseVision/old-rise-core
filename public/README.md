# Rise UI

Rise is a next generation crypto-currency and decentralized application platform, written entirely in JavaScript. For more information please refer to our website: https://rise.vision/.

This repository contains the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) based user-interface submodule of the Rise client. This will be replaced by a React based UI in the near future.

## Installation
TL;DR:
``` npm install && bower install && grunt release ```


Install node modules:

```
npm install
```

Install bower components:

```
bower install
```

Build the user-interface:

```
grunt release
```
