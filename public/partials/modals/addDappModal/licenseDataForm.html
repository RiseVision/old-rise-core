		<p translate>You are about to register a decentralized application (dapp) on the Rise network. After the registration completes, Rise users will be able to see your dapp on the Rise Dapp Store, and they will also be able to install and launch it.<br><br>Please note, one of the characteristics of blockchains is that they are immutable. Therefore make sure you have used the correct dapp parameters. We also advise you to test your dapp on the official Rise testnet so you can guarantee that it is working flawlessly.<br><br><b>Things you need to know for the registration process:</b><br><br>• Dapp names are unique, therefore you can't register the same name twice on the Rise network.<br>• Each Dapp is linked to a corresponding zip archive and optional icon.<br>• Make sure that your dapp icon has a square aspect ratio.<br>• Choose your tags wisely, as they will be used as search keywords within the Dapp Store.<br><br>The Rise Team does not accept liability for any dapps uploaded to the network, solely the uploader does. Therefore please ensure your dapp is legal within your jurisdiction and doesn't pose any harm to its users.</p>
